This project is built using OpenCV, Mediapipe and CV Zone(version 1.5.6) libraries. OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time
computer vision. Mediapipe offers opensource cross-platform, customizable ML solutions for live and streaming media. Not to mention the Numpy library which
brings the computational power of languages like C and Fortran to Python, a language much easier to learn and use.(which is basically used for image processing,
quantum computing, statistical computing, signal processing etc.)

This blink counter module counts the number of times a person blinked and we are plotting it on a graph live.
